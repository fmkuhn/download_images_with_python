This downloads a list of images (given as a list of URLs in a file).
The file may contain empty lines and lines starting with a '#', i.e., comments.

It saves each of them in a directory (according to the server's structure 
the images was on) below the directory this script is run in, e.g., 
'http://www.foo.de/bar/xyz.jpg' would be saved in './www.foo.de/bar/xyz.jpg'.

Default behavior:
- The error log file is named 'errors.log' (see option '-e')
- Images that were already downloaded on a previous run, are ignored (see option '-r')
- The number of URLs in the inputfile is counted for easier visualization of the progress 
  (empty lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored). (see option '-d')
 
Usage: download_images_<version>.py -i <inputfile> [-e <errorfile> -r -d]

		-h, --help                      Show help
