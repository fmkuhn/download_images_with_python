This downloads a list of images (given as a list of URLs in a file).

It saves each of them in a directory (according to the server's structure 
the images was on) below the directory this script is run in, e.g., 
'http://www.foo.de/bar/xyz.jpg' would be saved in './www.foo.de/bar/xyz.jpg'.

TODO For large lists of files, it would be useful to show progress, 
e.g., 'Image 1 out of xxxx...'
